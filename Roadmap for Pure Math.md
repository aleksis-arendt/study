- Books: _Complex Analysis_ — Ahlfors, _Visual Complex Analysis_ — Needham
    

### Differential Geometry

- Curves & surfaces, manifolds
    
- Books: _Differential Geometry of Curves & Surfaces_ — Do Carmo
    

### Algebraic Topology

- Fundamental group, homology, cohomology
    
- Books: _Algebraic Topology_ — Hatcher
    

### Advanced Algebra

- Commutative algebra, homological algebra
    
- Books: _Introduction to Commutative Algebra_ — Atiyah & MacDonald
    

### Logic & Set Theory

- Ordinals, cardinals, ZFC
    
- Books: _Set Theory_ — Kunen
    

**Timing:** Depends on your research direction — pick one or two tracks.

---

# 🔷 **Parallel Tracks (Possible Combinations)**

|Track 1 (Analysis)|Track 2 (Algebra & Topology)|
|---|---|
|Real Analysis|Abstract Algebra|
|Measure Theory|Topology|
|Functional Analysis|Galois Theory|
|Sobolev Spaces|Algebraic Topology|
|Harmonic Analysis|Homological Algebra|

# 📝 Notes

✅ You can start **Abstract Algebra & Topology in parallel with Measure Theory** — they’re largely independent.  
✅ You can also do **Complex Analysis after Real Analysis (or even alongside Royden).**  
✅ Differential Geometry and Algebraic Topology depend on Topology & Analysis.  
✅ Functional Analysis & Sobolev spaces depend on Measure Theory.
